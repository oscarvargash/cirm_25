# Workshop on basic bash and R programming skills 

> **NOTE** 
> This was developed/organized for the CIRM workshop at Cal Poly Humboldt in the summer of 2025.  

The aim of the workshop is to provide the attendants with the jump-start skills necessary to begin using bash and the R programing language. 

This course is going to be hands-on starting from the basics. We expect every assistant to log into their virtual HSU machine in the computer lab. We will go over exercises during class, our workshop is designed so students can copy and paste the code directly into their machines.

## What to expect?

At the end of the course participants will be comfortable using the R environment and using a pipeline designed to analize single cell transcriptomic data.

## Program (subject to change):

[D-1](https://github.com/oscarvargash/cirm_24/tree/main/day_1) introduction to bash: file and folder management, text files, cat, grep, recursion

[D-2](https://github.com/oscarvargash/cirm_24/tree/main/day_2) introduction to R, R elements, importing datasets

[D-3](https://github.com/oscarvargash/cirm_24/tree/main/day_3) Single cell analysis with seurat
